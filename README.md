# AI-Assignment
  Using AI for this assignment had many benefits. One benefit was that it sped up the process. Instead of having to type everything out, it typed everything for me much faster than I could. There were many repetitve processes and ChatGPT was fast at it. Also, if I had questions on why something wasn't working, it would help be trouble shoot. Every move was clear and laid out. Another benefit is that it didn't need to be reminded what certain topics were or how to calculate things like the model metrics. It already knew everything. 
    
    One danger could be if someone doesn't know why specific metrics are used, the results could be misinterpreted. Overfitting and underfitting could be a problem that might remain unchecked. A model might be suggested with high accuracy, but low recall for fraud detection, which would not be a good thing in this case. As for when I needed to correct the AI output, I needed to change some colors on the heatmap and bar graphs for example. Another one was when the legends for the scatterplots had the same color, I needed to change some code to correctly display the legend.
